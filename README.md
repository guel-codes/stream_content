# Overview:
- This is a repo for some of the code exploration that I want to do while I stream. 
- This will not store all the code because I plan on working through actual projects on stream as well

## Topics
 - Python module exploration:
    - Collections
        - ChainMap
        - Counter
        - Defaultdict
        - etc
- Intermediate and Advanced Python Conepts
    - Decorators
    - Generators

- Data Engineering and Data Science Stuff


This is still a work in progress so we will see how it goes
